# Improvements

1. Disabled Spin, if the wheel is already in spinning state.
2. Instead of Mouse Click, spin wheel spins on "Tap to Spin" button click.
3. Added background music while wheel is spinning.
4. Added confetti tween animation when the wheel stops spinning and a prize is won to make the game more engaging and attractive.
